In 1934, famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot solves a theft at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The obsessive-compulsive — who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth to be a curse — wants to rest in Istanbul, but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, nephew of the director of the Simplon-route Orient Express service, arranges a bunk for him aboard the train.

Unscrupulous businessman Edward Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and later sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.

The next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett was murdered during the night after having been stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person, and Caroline Hubbard, a fellow passenger, claims that a man had been in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom.

Ratchett’s true identity is exposed: He was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. Although her family paid the ransom, Daisy was murdered anyway. Her death so profoundly shocked her mother Sonia, that she gave birth prematurely to a stillborn baby and subsequently died herself; Daisy's father, Colonel John Armstrong, then committed suicide. Susanne, the family’s nursemaid, was wrongly suspected of complicity, arrested, and subsequently committed suicide in police custody, only later to be found innocent.
